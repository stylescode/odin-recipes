  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>General Tso's Chicken is a Chinese-American dish of fried chicken pieces that are breaded and tossed in a tangy sauce. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lb chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup corn starch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra light olive oil, for frying, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced ginger, from a 2-inch piece of ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, or 1 Tbsp grated or finely minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or added to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame seeds, optional for garnish</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>General Tso's Sauce</h4>  
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>5 tbsp low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>4 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
      </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Toss chicken in batches with cornstarch, tapping off the excess. Set dredged chicken on a platter and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a separate dish, combine all the ingredients for your sauce and whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet with oil. Cook chicken in 2 to 3 batches, sauteeing until golden on both sides and cooked through then remove the chicken from the pan and transfer to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining chicken, adding more oil as needed. Leave at least 1 Tbsp oil in the pan.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic, ginger and pepper flakes. Sautee for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the sauce to the skillet and bring it to a simmer while stirring. Let it simmer for 1 minute to cook off the vinegar a little. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce or rice vinegar to taste if desired. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Serve garnished with sesame seeds if desired.</li>
    </ol>
